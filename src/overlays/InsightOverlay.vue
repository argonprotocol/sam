          <p>Bitcoins play a pivotal role in the Argon ecosystem. Vaulted bitcoin are required to burn a predetermined amount of argons to unlock. This amount fluctuates based on
            Argon's price. When Argon's price is below target, the mathematical formula creates a massive wall of shorts that consumes all excess tokens.</p>

          <p>Bitcoins can only be added when the ratio of argons minted by bitcoins is less than 50% of circulation. At the start of {{ dayjs.utc(item.startingDate).format('MMM D') }}, Argons minted by Bitcoin was at {{ ((item.startingVaultMeta.argonsMintedByBitcoins / item.startingCirculation) * 100).toFixed(2) }}%, which meant {{ Math.round((item.startingCirculation/2) - item.startingVaultMeta.argonsMintedByBitcoins) }} new argons could be minted.</p>
          <p>For more details see pages 12-14 of <em>Whitepaper #2</em>.</p>

        <div v-if="id === 'bitcoinProfits'" class="space-y-2">
          <p>Bitcoins are heavily incentived to participate in Argon vaults for multiple reasons. In addition to hedging Bitcoin price drops, vaults allow bitcoins to earn ratcheting yields when Bitcoin's price fluctuates as well as from covering shorts whenever Argon's price drops.</p>
          <p>To better understand the incentives for bitcoins to enter Argon vaults, see <em>Whitepaper #2</em> or explore our Liquid Locking simulation tool.</p>
        </div>

        <div v-if="id === 'argonRelativeToDollar'" class="space-y-2">
          <p>Argon uses an internal inflation index to maintain consistent value over time. This means the Argon is a truly hard currency with no inflation or deflation. Since the dollar is (and has historically been) an inflationary currency, Argon's value is expected to consistently increase over time relative to the dollar.</p>
        </div>

        <div v-if="id === 'argonLosses'" class="space-y-2">
          <p>Due to the way pricing incentives are placed on both sides of Argon's price, the only loser during a price drop is the person who sells below target due to fear or some other panic. The flip side of the trade are the vaulted bitcoins who profit, and of course, the currency itself which restabilizes due to the burning of excess tokens.</p>
        </div>

        <div v-if="id === 'seigniorageProfits'" class="space-y-2">
          <p>Argon's stabilization mechanisms have no need for U.S. Treasury Bonds or reserve accounts. This allows for a seigniorage business model, which means all incoming capital accrues directly to the network's Ownership Tokens and network mining nodes..</p>
        </div>

        <div v-if="id === 'seigniorageLosses'" class="space-y-2">
          <p>In no circumstance will Ownership Tokens incur losses due to Argon instability. The token's primary purpose is to provide governance oversight and absorb excess capital when Argon's price rises above target. If Argon drops below target, instead of penalizing Ownership Tokens, other mechanisms are used to restabilize.</p>

            All standard peer-to-peer Argon transactions are taxed a flat 20¢ regardless of whether the transaction is valued at $2 or $2B. The stat shown above is the total number of 
            annual transactions across the entire network. You can customize this property in your model's configuration settings.

        <div v-if="id === 'annualMicropayments'" class="space-y-2">
          <p>Micropayments are categorized as any transaction valued at less than $1.00. The network enacts a 20% tax on these transactions. Due to our novel Wage Protection algorithm, the quantity of taxes that are burned when Argon's price drops below target rises substantially. See <em>Whitepaper #2</em> for more details.</p>
          <p>We expect the vast majority of micropayments to be driven by demand from the Ulixee Data Network.</p>
